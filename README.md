# Bits-and-Bobs
This is a collection of random small projects that I accumulate over time.

Naturally these tend to be fairly messy and usually lack comments as they usually to experiment with some idea rather than to produce some reasonable result.

Your eyes have been warned, is what I'm implying here.

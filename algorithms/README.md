# Algorithms

This is just a collection of random algorithm implementations I've accumulated over time.

Stored as <algorithm>/language/code

Generally anything implemented in Python here is going to be horrendously slow, but it's best not to think about it.
More specifically I'm referring to the huffman implementation which is a fascinating trainwreck.
